Fix closed request



!!!update setupserver 120  getLocation (is file) and 108 isLocation
Chanked , request:
    {
        int     fd_new_socket;
        Std:string request; var
        int body_lenght ; const
        int readed_body ; var

    }

To check :
* - the select (or equivalent) should be in the main loop and should check fd for read and write AT THE SAME TIME
- Search for all read/recv/write/send on a socket and check that if an error returned the client is removed / close connection!
-  (checking only -1 or 0 is not good you should check both)
* - Writing or reading ANY file descriptor without going through the select (or equivalent) 
* - curl --resolve server1:8081:127.0.0.1 http://server1:8081/
